# Project Brief: Developer Relations Automation (Content Focused) - v1

## Core Requirements

### DevRel Content Ideation & Planning:

- System to capture, track, and prioritize content ideas (e.g., blog posts, tutorials, videos, social media) using Firebase.
- Content calendar and planning tools integrated within the Next.js application with data stored in Firebase.
- For v1, manual content topic ideation based on team input (Neo4j knowledge base integration planned for future versions).

### AI-Assisted Content Generation:

- Integration with AI language models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, or similar via APIs) to assist in drafting content.
- Simple context provision for AI models using Firebase-stored metadata and manual input.
- Features for refining AI-generated drafts, including tone adjustment, technical accuracy checks, and SEO optimization.
- (Neo4j knowledge base integration for enhanced context provision planned for future versions)

### Content Library Management:

- A centralized repository within the Next.js application with metadata stored in Firebase to manage all DevRel content assets.
- Rich tagging, categorization, and search functionality for the content library (implemented with Firebase).
- Version control or history tracking for key content pieces.
- Ability to easily find, reuse, and repurpose existing content.

### Knowledge Base for Content Enrichment (Future Version):

- Connect to company data sources (code, docs, existing content) to build a graph of entities, relationships, and technical concepts in Neo4j.
- This knowledge base will serve to:
  - Fuel content ideation.
  - Provide factual grounding and source material for AI content generation.
  - Help identify experts or source materials for specific topics.
  - Surface relationships between different pieces of technical information for comprehensive content.
- Note: Not included in v1, planned for future enhancement.

### Content Review & Collaboration Workflow:

- Workflow management using Firebase for data storage with N8N for automation of content review, feedback, and approval cycles.
- Integration with common collaboration tools or in-app commenting features.
- All workflow states and metadata stored in Firebase.

### Content Publishing & Distribution:

- Integration (via N8N or direct Next.js integration) with various publishing platforms (company blog, documentation sites, social media channels, community forums).
- Automation of content formatting and scheduling.

### Application & Automation Stack (v1):

- Next.js for the primary user interface and content management front-end.
- Firebase as the sole database for v1 (user accounts, content metadata, workflow states, AI configurations, and all application logic).
- N8N for automation of AI content pipelines, publishing workflows, and cron jobs.
- (Neo4j integration planned for future versions)

## Goals

- üöÄ **Dramatically Increase Content Velocity & Output**: Enable the DevRel team to produce significantly more high-quality content by streamlining ideation, drafting (with AI), and publishing.
- üéØ **Enhance Content Relevance & Impact**: Ensure content is timely, technically accurate, and directly addresses the needs and interests of the developer community by leveraging insights from the knowledge base and targeted AI generation.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Elevate Content Quality & Consistency**: Maintain a high standard of quality and a consistent voice across all DevRel content, supported by AI writing assistance and a centralized knowledge source.
- üìö **Build and Manage a Comprehensive Content Library**: Create an easily accessible, well-organized, and reusable library of all developer-facing content.
- üí° **Empower Data-Driven Content Strategy**: Use insights from the knowledge base and content performance (future goal) to make informed decisions about what content to create and prioritize.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Optimize DevRel Workflows**: Free up DevRel professionals from repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on strategic content planning, community engagement, and creating high-value, complex pieces.

## Scope

### In Scope:

#### Content Management System (Next.js & Firebase):

- Dashboard for content overview, status, and planning.
- Content idea submission and prioritization board.
- Content calendar view.
- Rich text editor for drafting and refining content.
- Content library with tagging, categorization, search, and versioning.

#### AI Content Generation Integration:

- Integration with at least one major AI language model API.
- Simple context provision mechanism using Firebase-stored data.
- Tools for prompting and refining AI-generated content (e.g., outlines, summaries, drafts).

#### N8N Automation:

- Workflows for AI content generation pipelines.
- Workflows for publishing to selected platforms.
- Basic review/approval notification workflows.

#### User Management:

- Authentication and basic roles (e.g., writer, editor, admin).

### Out of Scope (for initial version, could be future enhancements):

- Neo4j knowledge graph integration (planned for future versions)
- Training custom AI models (focus is on using existing foundation models via APIs).
- Deep, real-time, bi-directional sync with all possible external CMSs or content platforms (focus on primary publishing channels).
- Advanced, granular content performance analytics and A/B testing features.
- Public-facing content portal (tool is for internal DevRel team).
- Sophisticated semantic search within the content library beyond robust tagging/keyword search.
- Full replacement of specialized SEO tools.

## Key Stakeholders

- **Developer Relations Team (Content Creators & Strategists)**: Primary users. They will rely on the tool for the entire content lifecycle ‚Äì from ideation and AI-assisted drafting to managing the content library and publishing.
- **Engineering/Product Teams**: Their output (code, internal docs) forms the basis of the knowledge graph. They benefit from more accurate and comprehensive DevRel content about their work.
- **Marketing Team**: May collaborate on content themes, SEO, and distribution strategies. Will benefit from increased content output and consistency.
- **Project Sponsor/Management**: Expect increased DevRel efficiency, higher content output, improved developer engagement through better content, and a robust, manageable content ecosystem.
- **(Potentially) Community Managers**: Can use the tool to identify relevant content to share or to understand what topics are being actively worked on by DevRel.

## Timeline & Milestones

This section would depend heavily on team size, resources, and specific priorities. However, a content-focused phased approach might look like this:

### Phase 1: Content Foundation & Basic AI (e.g., 2-3 Months)

- **Milestone**: Next.js app setup with Firebase for basic content (drafts, ideas) storage and user auth.
- **Milestone**: Integration with an AI model API for basic text generation (e.g., summarizing text, drafting sections based on prompts).
- **Milestone**: Simple content drafting interface in Next.js with AI assist button.

### Phase 2: Content Library & Workflow Automation (e.g., 2-3 Months)

- **Milestone**: Develop content library features in Next.js (tagging, search, organization) with Firebase.
- **Milestone**: Implement N8N workflows for AI content generation with Firebase data.
- **Milestone**: Basic content review/approval workflow (N8N notifications).
- **Milestone**: Integration for publishing to one primary channel (e.g., company blog).

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features & Integration (e.g., Ongoing)

- **Milestone**: Neo4j integration for knowledge graph capabilities (future version feature).
- **Milestone**: More sophisticated AI interaction models (e.g., AI-driven outline creation, content repurposing suggestions).
- **Milestone**: Expand N8N publishing workflows to more channels.
- **Milestone**: Refine UI/UX for content planning and management based on feedback.
