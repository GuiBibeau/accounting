# Active Context

## Current Focus

The primary focus was implementing a grid display for published YouTube videos on the `/youtube/channel` page. This involved fetching video data from Firestore and presenting it using Shadcn UI components.

## Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Published YouTube Videos Grid**: Added functionality to display a grid of a user's published YouTube videos.
  - Created `src/components/youtube/YouTubeVideoCard.tsx`:
    - Displays a single video's thumbnail, title, publication date, and stats (views, likes, comments).
    - Uses `next/image` for optimized thumbnail display.
    - Includes a helper function to format large numbers for stats (e.g., 1.2K, 1.5M).
    - Defines `YouTubeVideoDetails` type for the video data it expects.
  - Created `src/components/youtube/PublishedVideosGrid.tsx`:
    - Renders a responsive grid of `YouTubeVideoCard` components.
    - Handles loading, error, and empty states.
    - Updated to use `PublishedVideosGridSkeleton` during loading.
  - Created `src/components/youtube/YouTubeVideoCardSkeleton.tsx`:
    - Provides a skeleton UI for a single video card.
  - Created `src/components/youtube/PublishedVideosGridSkeleton.tsx`:
    - Renders a grid of `YouTubeVideoCardSkeleton` components.
  - Modified `src/app/(app)/youtube/channel/page.tsx`:
    - Integrated `PublishedVideosGrid` to display videos.
    - Implemented `fetchPublishedVideos` function to:
      - Retrieve the user's Firebase ID token.
      - Call the `/api/youtube/channel-details` API to get the `channelId`.
      - Query the `youtubeChannels/{channelId}/videos` Firestore collection, ordering by `publishedAt` descending.
      - Map Firestore documents to the `YouTubeVideoDetails` type.
    - Updated component state to manage fetched videos, loading status, and errors.
    - Corrected import for `YouTubeVideoDetails` type to point to `YouTubeVideoCard.tsx`.
    - The page now focuses on displaying published YouTube videos from Firestore, replacing the previous logic that handled internally uploaded videos via `VideoGrid` and `getUserVideos`.
- **Previous - YouTube Page Enhancement (Last Synced Time)**:
  - Created `src/app/api/youtube/channel-details/route.ts` to fetch `channelId`.
  - `src/app/(app)/youtube/page.tsx` was modified to use this API (though it now redirects to `/youtube/channel`).
  - `src/components/site-header.tsx` updated to display `lastSyncedAt`.
- **Previous - Firebase Admin Auth**: Corrected import in API route.
- **Previous - Timestamp Storage**: Confirmed `lastSyncedAt` storage path.

## Next Steps

1. Verify the "Published YouTube Videos" grid display and skeleton loader on the `/youtube/channel` page.
2. Consider any further UI/UX refinements for the video cards, grid, or skeleton loader.
3. Update `progress.md` to reflect the completion of the skeleton loader feature.
