## Current Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the YouTube management page by displaying the last synchronization time. This involves fetching data from Firestore and updating UI components.

## Recent Changes & Decisions

- **YouTube Page Enhancement**: Added functionality to display the "last synced" time for a user's YouTube channel on the `/youtube` page.
  - Created a new API route `src/app/api/youtube/channel-details/route.ts` to securely fetch the user's YouTube `channelId` using their ID token. This route uses `getChannelMetadata` from `src/lib/youtube.ts` (server-side).
  - Modified `src/app/(app)/youtube/page.tsx`:
    - It now calls the `/api/youtube/channel-details` API to get the `channelId`.
    - Upon receiving the `channelId`, it fetches the `lastSyncedAt` timestamp from the Firestore document at `youtubeChannels/${channelId}/metadata/doc`.
    - The timestamp is formatted using `toDate().toLocaleString()`.
    - The `user.getIdToken()` method is used to obtain the Firebase ID token for authenticated API requests, correcting a previous assumption about `useAuth()` providing `getIdToken` directly.
  - Updated `src/components/site-header.tsx`:
    - The `SiteHeaderProps` type now includes an optional `lastSyncedAt?: string | null;` prop.
    - The component now displays this timestamp next to the page title if provided, formatted as "(Synced: {lastSyncedAt})".
- **Firebase Admin Auth**: Corrected the import in the new API route to use `adminAuth` from `@/lib/firebase-admin` instead of a non-existent `auth` export for verifying ID tokens.
- **Timestamp Storage**: Confirmed that the `lastSyncedAt` timestamp is stored in Firestore by the `syncYoutubeDataForCloudFunction` in `functions/src/lib/youtube-cf.ts` at the path `youtubeChannels/{channelId}/metadata/doc`.

## Next Steps

1. Verify the "last synced" time display on the YouTube management page.
2. Consider error handling and loading states for the "last synced" time display.
3. Update `progress.md` to reflect the completion of this feature.
