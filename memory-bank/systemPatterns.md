# System Patterns

## System Architecture Overview

_Provide a high-level description of the system's architecture. Include key components and how they interact. A diagram (e.g., Mermaid) can be very helpful here._

## Key Technical Decisions & Rationale

_Document major technical choices made during the project (e.g., choice of a specific database, framework, or architectural pattern). Explain the reasons behind these decisions._

## Design Patterns in Use

_List and briefly describe any significant design patterns employed in the codebase (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, MVC, etc.). Explain where and why they are used._

## Component Relationships & Data Flow

_Describe how major components or modules interact with each other. Illustrate the flow of data through the system. Diagrams are encouraged._

## Critical Implementation Paths

_Identify any core functionalities or critical paths in the system that are particularly complex or important to understand. Provide details about their implementation._

## Error Handling & Resilience

_Describe the system's approach to error handling, logging, and ensuring resilience. How are failures managed?_

## Security Considerations

_Outline key security measures, patterns, and considerations implemented in the system._
