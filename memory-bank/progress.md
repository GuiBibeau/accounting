# Project Progress

## Current Status Overview

_Provide a brief summary of the project's current state. Is it on track, delayed, or ahead of schedule (if applicable)? What's the general health of the project?_

## What Works (Implemented Features)

- **Published YouTube Videos Grid**: The `/app/youtube/channel` page now displays a grid of the user's published YouTube videos.
  - Fetches video data (title, thumbnail, stats, published date) from Firestore collection `youtubeChannels/{channelId}/videos`.
  - Uses new components `YouTubeVideoCard.tsx` (for individual video display) and `PublishedVideosGrid.tsx` (for the grid layout).
  - `YouTubeVideoCard.tsx` includes number formatting for stats and uses `next/image`.
  - `ChannelPage.tsx` was updated to fetch this data using the user's `channelId` (obtained via `/api/youtube/channel-details`) and display it using the new grid.
- **YouTube Page - Last Synced Time**: The YouTube management page (`/app/youtube`, which redirects to `/app/youtube/channel`) now displays the last time the user's YouTube channel data was synchronized with the application. This information appears in the site header next to the page title.
  - An API route (`/api/youtube/channel-details`) was created to fetch the user's YouTube channel ID.
  - Client-side logic in `YouTubePage.tsx` (and now effectively in `ChannelPage.tsx` via layout/context) calls this API, then fetches the `lastSyncedAt` timestamp from Firestore (`youtubeChannels/{channelId}/metadata/doc`).
  - The `SiteHeader.tsx` component was updated to display this timestamp.
- **Encryption Key Handling**: Resolved issues with `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for local Firebase emulator development, ensuring correct key format and usage in both Next.js and Firebase Functions.
- **Firebase Functions Build Process**: Clarified the manual build step required for Firebase Functions changes in the local environment.
- **Local Development Workflow**: Documented the necessity of an always-running Firebase emulator suite.

## Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings

_Summarize how key decisions have evolved over time. What has been learned during the project that has influenced its direction or implementation? This can include technical learnings, changes in requirements, or user feedback._

- **Encryption Key Handling**: A significant learning involved the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` management for communication between the Next.js backend and Firebase Functions.
  - Initial Assumption: `firebase functions:config:set` would manage the key for local emulators.
  - Correction: For local development with Firebase Emulators, the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be defined in `.env.local` files for both the root project (Next.js) and the `functions` directory.
  - Key Representation: The `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (AES-256-GCM) must be a 64-character hexadecimal string.
  - Buffer Conversion: Code in both `src/lib/encryption.ts` and `functions/src/lib/encryption-cf.ts` was updated to correctly validate this hex string and convert it to a 32-byte Buffer using `Buffer.from(key, 'hex')`. Previously, it incorrectly used `utf-8` for validation and conversion, leading to decryption failures.
- **Firebase Functions Build Process**: It was clarified that changes to Firebase Functions (in `functions/src`) require a manual rebuild step (`npm run build` within the `functions` directory) for the changes to take effect in the local emulators.
- **Local Development Workflow**: The necessity of an always-running Firebase emulator suite (`firebase emulators:start`) for local development has been formally documented.
- **Client-Side Data Fetching for YouTube Page**:
  - Implemented an API route to fetch `channelId` needed for client-side Firestore queries.
  - Updated `YouTubePage.tsx` (now `ChannelPage.tsx` for primary display) to fetch and display `lastSyncedAt` from `youtubeChannels/{channelId}/metadata/doc`.
  - Corrected Firebase ID token retrieval on the client using `user.getIdToken()`.
  - Updated `SiteHeader.tsx` to display the fetched `lastSyncedAt` time.
- **Published Video Grid Implementation**:
  - Identified the correct Firestore path for YouTube video data (`youtubeChannels/{channelId}/videos`) and the `VideoDetails` type.
  - Created `YouTubeVideoCard.tsx` for displaying individual video details with Shadcn UI.
  - Created `PublishedVideosGrid.tsx` to arrange video cards in a responsive grid.
  - Modified `ChannelPage.tsx` to fetch data from the correct Firestore path and use the new grid components, replacing the old `VideoGrid` which was for internal uploads.

## Future Considerations & Potential Enhancements

_Note any ideas for future improvements, enhancements, or features that are out of scope for the current iteration but might be considered later._

- **Developer Experience (DX) Improvements**:
  - Automating the Firebase Functions build process to avoid manual `npm run build` after every change.
  - Streamlining the setup and management of environment variables for local development.
